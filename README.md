 Merkle Tree Implementation in Rust

This is a simple implementation of a Merkle Tree data structure in Rust. Merkle Trees are hash trees that are widely used in blockchain and distributed systems for efficient and secure verification of large datasets.

## Features

- Constructs a Merkle Tree from a list of data blocks
- Verifies the integrity of the Merkle Tree by recalculating the root hash and comparing it to the expected root hash
- Written in Rust for efficiency and safety

## Usage

1. Install Rust and Cargo if you haven't already. You can find installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/merkle_tree.git](https://github.com/isoprophlex/rusty-merkle-tree/)
